a regional hub for pharmaceutical manufacturing However, the sector is still in its infantry, with very limited industry and the workforce required to build up the sector is almost absent Thererfore, the investment of BioNTech is considered vital to attract more companies and to build a conducive ecosystem needed for pharmaceutical production\\nTo successfully build a conducive ecosystem for the pharmaceutical and biotechnological sector, a range of interlinked elements need to be put in place and a close collaboration among stakeholders is essential Moreover, potential investors have a range

Project\\xa0\\nReport to: Senior Programs Manager & Disability Inclusion Advisor\\nGeographical Location of the Project: Huye & Bugesera Districts\\nChance for Childhood is an award-winning charity working in Africa to support the most vulnerable children, such as street children, disabled children, children affected by conflict and kids behind bars Our vision is to fight for every child\\nWe work with African visionary community leaders to implement locally relevant yet far-reaching projects that create lasting change within the justice, education, and social protection sectors This enables us to focus on ‘hard to reach’ children, both in terms of their complex needs (eg, street children with learning difficulties) and location (eg, urban violent slums or remote rural areas) Together we make ideas and impact both sustainable and scalable to protect, educate and empower even more of the world’s most disadvantaged children Our interventions in Africa are in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)\\nTubarere Mu Muryango is the implementation strategy for the National Childcare Reform that was implemented since 2013 with the goal of reintegrating children living in institutions and transform Rwanda’s childcare and protection system into a family-based system of care\\xa0 In 2016, a national assessment showed that over 4,000 children with disabilities were still residing in the institutions In 2018, a baseline assessment showed that some parents were in need for additional support to care for their children with disabilities \\xa0\\nTo help parents find solutions to that problem, UNICEF in partnership with Chance for Childhood have started implementing\\xa0“Family strengthening and Community based support for care of children with disabilities in families Programme”\\xa0since July 2021\\nThis programme has three main objectives, such as to support those children and their families to access mainstream and disability-related services (education, healthcare, rehabilitation and social protection, child protection…) It also intends to facilitate parents/caregivers to access self-help groups and other community-based initiatives to respond to immediate special needs and build resilience for sustainable family-based care of their children with disabilities The current programme will also ensure that community-based structures have necessary knowledge/capacity to provide and support children with disabilities and their families\\nThe programme has so far mapped 6689 children with disabilities and/or developmental delays in\\xa0Huye and Bugesera Districts;\\xa0has trained 6689 parents of children with disabilities and grouped them in 146 Parents Support Groups which helps them to provide psychosocial support to one another In this programme, 7858 referrals were made to hospitals, rehabilitation centres, Education (Early childhood, primary, special school and TEVT), social and child protection \\xa0\\xa0Out of the referrals made, about 3034 % got the services whilst the remainder 6966 % are still facing different challenges\\nTo respond to the issue concerning large group of children with multiple impairments who could not make it to the hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the programme created 138 rehabilitation sites whereby each site has about ten (10) children with disabilities attending the rehabilitation services twice a week\\nOur monitoring assessments also showed that about 1310 children with disabilities need different assistive devices out of which, 220 devices were recently provided by Chance for Childhood in close collaboration with CECHE Foundation and UNICEF Rwanda \\xa0\\nThe midline study and subsequent report is needed to assess the extent to which targets have been achieved thus far in the project, understand the determinants enabling and/or disabling achievement of targets, the extent of ownership built among the target groups, capture key learning from the implementation experience and recommend doable actions for the remaining project period\\nThe objective of this midline survey is to see whether the project is on the right path to achieving what it is supposed to achieve, examine the possible enablers and disablers of the project achievements This survey will also show the alternative ways to achieving sustainability and ownership by the government institutions \\xa0\\xa0\\nSeveral stakeholders both internal and outside of CfC have interest in the data collection and results of the Midline survey of these will be

            "               <Document: {'content': 'TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SECOND GENERATION OF THE COUNTRY GENDER STATUS REPORT FOR RWANDA\\nThe Government of Rwanda has made women’s empowerment and inclusion a hallmark of recovery and reconstruction of the Country This approach has been globally hailed as novel in both intent and scope Gender Equality in the country is driven by the political will at the highest levels, the establishment of National Gender Machinery Institutions (Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, Gender Monitoring Office, National Women’s Council), existing favorable policies and programs including home grown solutions as well as the revision and amendment of discriminatory laws or adoption of gender related laws such as: Law Governing Land in Rwanda which guarantees equal rights on land access, ownership and utilization; Law establishing and governing maternity leave benefits scheme where a woman is allowed 3 months fully paid maternity leave and 4 days of paternity leave to name a few\\nIn its reconstruction journey, Rwanda has also a story to tell, a story of great achievements in several fields and specifically in positioning Gender Equality to the highest level of a constitutional fundamental principle of human rights, good governance and democracy Several assessments demonstrate Rwanda’s achievements such as the World Economic Gender Gap Report of 2022 which ranks Rwanda as the sixth country world wide out of 146 Countries on ability to close the Gender Gap in four fundamental areas namely; Economic Participaton and opportunity, Education, Health and Surival as well as Political Empowerment In addition, Rwandan women in leadership have played a pivotal role in the country’s political, economic and social development at all levels in the country In Parliament, women are represented at 613% while 303% as Heads of public institutions, 40% as Governors, 42% in Judiciary and 27% as presidents of District Councils\\xa0\\nIn relation to economic empowerment, Finscope Rwanda 2020 report states that only 8% of Rwandan women are financially excluded compared to 32% in 2012 and women have embraced existing opportunities including their enrolment and participation in saving groups whereby 49% of them (women) have a formal way of saving compared to 61% of their male counterparts ICT development in Rwanda has widened women’s education and financial opportunities among others In Education, Rwanda has promoted the enrolment of women in STEM fields whereby in Secondary schools, in 2020/2021, 484% of Girls were enrolled in STEM options versus 625 % of their male counterparts\\xa0\\nWithin the health sector, the health workforce and infrastructure development, innovative data collection tools including Rapid SMS for emergency labor and tracking the Maternal and Child health continuum of care have resulted in considerable decrease of maternal and infant mortality rates For example, DHS, 2019/2020 highlighted that the maternal mortality ratio has declined significantly to 203 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019/2020 from 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014-2015 down from 1071 in 2000 and the distribution of women aged 15-49 using modern contraceptive method stood at 584%\\nHowever, with the outbreak of COVID-19, the socio-economic trajectory of Rwanda alike many other countries in the world was negatively altered, with the Exports and Tourism sectors the most hit amid disruption in international trade and travels Recent assessments carried out on the impact of COVID-19 in Rwanda have consistently shown that women are adversely affected by COVID-19 economically due to their high involvement in the informal sector and underrepresentation in the digital economy, unsecure employment, as well as high involvement in unpaid care work and in subsistence farming For instance, a recent Covid-19 Gender Rapid Assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF)\\xa0in partnership with UN Women and UNFPA found that a high proportion of rural and urban women (59% and 52% respectively) reported closure of their businesses as a result of the pandemic, compared to 49% for men in both rural and urban areas In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated women and girls’ vulnerability to GBV GBV data released by RIB have shown an increase of GBV cases from 969 cases in March 2020 to 1,243 cases in June 2020 translating to 283 % increase in only three months of COVID-19\\nIn addition, Rwanda still faces some challenges that require concerted efforts to address gender equality related barriers and ensure the creation of robust gender accountability systems to advance the relevant GEWE legal and policy commitments The country has charted its way to reaching a Middle-Income Country (MIC) status and has been implementing Vision 2050 the framework that will see the Country’s accountability to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action\\nTo sustain the efforts to track the implementation of gender equality commitments and in line with the objectives of the State of Gender Equality in Rwanda (2019), the Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) in collaboration with UN WOMEN seeks to generate and disseminate a report that provides an up to date information on the status of gender equality including progress and gaps to provide evidence that informs policy priorities, decisions and initiatives to advance the country’s development agenda In this context, UN WOMEN on behalf of Gender Monitoring Office seeks to hire a senior consultant to develop a second generation of the ‘’Country Gender Status Report (CGSR)’’\\nThe main purpose of producing the second-generation Country Gender Status Report is to document and showcase Rwanda’s achievements on gender equality promotion, women’s empowerment across different sectors, the prevailing challenges, the promising practices and recommendations on priorities requiring much focus and action\\nSpecific objectives of the assignment include;\\nAssess and document Rwanda’s achievements on gender equality and women’s empowerment based on selected indicators\\nExamine the socio-cultural, economic, political, and legal barriers that hinder the full implementation of GEWE commitments and the available opportunities to accelerate efforts to address them\\nSpecifically provide an analysis of the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on women and men, with a specific analysis on how the multiple forms of discrimination experienced by women exacerbate the impact of the pandemic on their lives\\nIdentify good practices and lessons learned from relevant GEWE related initiatives at national and local levels in Rwanda\\nOutline strategic recommendations to accelerate the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women in Rwanda\\nProduce a policy brief reflecting key

Childhood is an award-winning charity working in Africa to support the most vulnerable children, such as street children, disabled children, children affected by conflict and kids behind bars Our vision is to fight for every child We work with African visionary community leaders to implement locally relevant yet far-reaching projects that create lasting change within the justice, education, and social protection sectors This enables us to focus on ‘hard to reach’ children, both in terms of their complex needs (eg, street children with learning difficulties) and location (eg, urban violent slums or remote rural areas) Together we make ideas and impact both sustainable and scalable to protect, educate and empower even more of the world’s most disadvantaged children\\nOur interventions in Africa are in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)\\nTubarere Mu Muryango is the implementation strategy for the National Childcare Reform which was established since 2013 with the goal of reintegrating children living in institutions and transform Rwanda’s childcare and protection system into a family-based system of care\\xa0 In 2016, a national assessment showed that over 4,000 children with disabilities were still residing in the institutions In 2018, a baseline assessment showed that some parents were in need of additional support to care for their children with disabilities\\xa0\\nTo help parents find solutions to that problem, UNICEF in partnership with Chance for Childhood have started implementing\\xa0“Family strengthening and Community based support for care of children with disabilities in families Programme”\\xa0since July 2021\\nThis programme has three main objectives, such as to support those children and their families to access mainstream and disability-related services (education, healthcare, rehabilitation and social protection, child protection…) It also intends to facilitate parents/caregivers to access self-help groups and other community-based initiatives to respond to immediate special needs and build resilience for sustainable family-based care of their children with disabilities The current programme also ensures that community-based structures have necessary knowledge/capacity to provide and support children with disabilities and their families\\nThe programme has so far mapped 6689 children with disabilities and/or developmental delays in\\xa0Huye and Bugesera Districts;\\xa0has trained 6689 parents of children with disabilities and grouped them in 146 Parents Support Groups which helps them to provide psychosocial support to one another In this programme, 7858 referrals were made to hospitals, rehabilitation centres, Education (Early childhood, primary, special school and TEVT), social and child protection\\xa0\\xa0 Out of the referrals made, about 3034 % got the services whilst the remainder 6966 % are still facing different challenges\\nTo respond to the issue concerning large group of children with multiple impairments who could not make it to the hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the programme created 138 rehabilitation sites whereby each site has about ten (10) children with disabilities attending the rehabilitation services twice a week\\nOur monitoring assessments also showed that about 1310 children with disabilities need different assistive devices out of which, 220 devices were recently provided by Chance for Childhood in close collaboration with CECHE Foundation and UNICEF Rwanda\\xa0\\nThe consultant will be expected to produce a 10-15 -page (maximum) programme brief right from the various reports and monitoring documents provided by CfC team The Programme brief should be a comprehensive package reflecting lessons learned from key milestones of the project:\\nMapping of children with disabilities\\nTraining the parents of children with disabilities\\nReferrals and challenges associated\\nHome accessibility and locally affordable assistive devices for the families of CwDs\\nDisability sensitive messages through radio and community advocacy events\\nTraining of existing community volunteers about how to support children with disabilities in the community\\nTraining of community frontline workers including the local authorities about how to provide inclusive services\\nEngaging with district authorities (lessons and challenges)\\nCoordination of the intervention\\n\\xa0\\xa0Purpose of the programme brief\\xa0 \\xa0\\nIn order to achieve a successful reintegration of children with disabilities and prevent new family separation, it is necessary to think about innovative strategies to deliver results for children and their families; it is therefore very crucial to provide information to stakeholders working on child protection and disability inclusion for them to get different options especially those that are proven effective that can help to make tailored & comprehensive package of interventions aiming at supporting children with disabilities reintegrated from institutions back to families, and to improve community and family-based care by increasing accessibility/affordability of basic services as well as addressing social norms, stigma and discrimination like the current programme for prevention of new family separation\\xa0 The package of interventions should be adapted to the individual community and consider the wider national context of low-resourced countries like Rwanda; this entails prioritizing interventions that build on existing resources/strengths to boost the capacity of communities for delivery of quality services to children and building of families’ resilience to adequately nurture and raise their children The programme brief would be a good documentation to think towards sustainability of the model project, and to open for scale-up by different stakeholders\\nThe programme brief will help the government of Rwanda and its stakeholders to:\\nDocument how the programme was developed\\nDocument how the programme was implemented\\nWhat challenges were encountered and how they were dealt with\\nKnow the extent to which mainstream and special services for children with disabilities are provided and challenges associated\\nKnow the extent to which access to parents’ peer support has helped parents restore their hope\\nKnow how community volunteers and community frontline workers should play a key role in the family and community care of CwDs\\nKnow how to tackle stigma and discrimination in the family of a CwD and in the community\\nKnow how CfC addressed issues related to affordability concerns for rehabilitation services of CwDs through community rehabilitation sites and locally made assistive devices\\nProvide insights on coordination and the role of districts authorities to promote community-based services to CWDs\\nGovernment of Rwanda and its stakeholders in child protection, social and disability inclusion at all levels have interest in the programme brief in which they will be asked to play a role \\xa0Table 1 below provides a preliminary stakeholder analysis, which should be deepened by the consultant during the documentation of the programme\\nAccountability to targeted populations, is tied to CfC commitments to include people we work with as key stakeholders in their work As such, CfC is committed to ensuring the involvement of children with disabilities, their guardians and parents and members of the support system including families of CwDs and respective communities\\nStakeholders Interested in the programme brief\\nChance for Childhood (Rwanda & UK offices)\\nResponsible\\xa0 \\xa0for\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0planning\\xa0 \\xa0and\\xa0 \\xa0operations implementation of the project It has a direct stake in the programme brief and will use the document to inform decision-making and advocacy with donors for adequate investment in children with disabilities \\xa0\\nUNICEF (as a donor) has an interest in the final product of programme brief to inform their advocacy and child protection strategies as well as learning from the programme they funded and advise to the government of Rwanda about key strategies, policies, thematic areas, or delivery modality and specifically to the programming in child protection and disability inclusion in the family and community\\nAs the ultimate recipients of the\\xa0Family Strengthening and Community Based Support for Care of Children with Disabilities in Families\\xa0interventions, beneficiaries have a stake in Chance for Childhood determining whether its assistance has been effective As such, the level of participation in the programme brief for CWDs, parents and guardians will be determined, and their respective perspectives will be sought\\nGovernment (NCDA & NCPD) and local leaders (districts, sectors, cells, and villages)\\nThe Government has a direct interest in keeping the records about\\xa0Family Strengthening and Community Based Support for Care of Children with Disabilities in Families’\\xa0activities in the country by ensuring that they are aligned with its priorities, harmonized with the action of other partners, and meet the expected results Issues related to capacity development of different stakeholders, handover and sustainability will be of interest to them\\nNGOs especially the ones in the current partnership are interested to know what lessons they should all learn from the work CfC has conducted\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe programme brief will focus on the 18-month project that CfC has implemented in 29 sectors of two districts (Bugesera & Huye) between July 2021- December 2022\\xa0\\nThe consultant will use the project monitoring reports and plans to document the programme brief\\nConcerning the quality of data and information, the consultant should:\\na\\xa0Assess data availability and reliability as part of the inception phase expanding on the information provided \\xa0\\nSystematically check accuracy, consistency, and validity of collected data and information and acknowledge any limitations/caveats in drawing conclusions using the data\\nTo respond to the above-mentioned deliverables, the consultant shall use the data from interviews with families, community-based service providers, and community/ local leaders, district authorities, Government national levels (NCPD & NCDA) which will contribute to an understanding of the current context as well as the experiences of these key stakeholders This, in combination with desk research, will provide a comprehensive understanding of how the programme of strengthening families and community-based support to children with disabilities and their families was developed and implemented This will help the consultant to write a succinct programme brief\\nCultural Sensitivity of programme brief \\xa0\\nThe consultant should have a wide and being

independence of the consultant but ensures the programme brief provide the necessary evidence in a clear and convincing way \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe consultant should be assured of the accessibility of all relevant documentation within the provisions of the acceptance disclosure of information procedures\\nThe consultant doesn’t need to look for Ethical clearance since CfC has obtained it at the very beginning of this intervention Additionally, the consultant should be aware of the no faces and Overexposed campaign which were recently launched by CfC However, the consultant is also expected to

            "               <Document: {'content': 'Terms of Reference for Consultant\\nConsultancy opportunity to conduct a Formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda\\xa0\\nDisability is a major public health concern worldwide and the situation for children with disabilities is even more serious The CRPD states that “persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others” Some children will be born with a disabling health condition or impairment, while others may experience disability as a result of illness, injury or poor nutrition Children with disabilities include those with health conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, traumatic spinal cord injury, Down syndrome, and children with hearing, visual, physical, communication and intellectual impairments A number of children have a single impairment while others may experience multiple impairments For example, a child with cerebral palsy may have mobility, communication and intellectual impairments The complex interaction between a health condition or impairment and environmental and personal factors means that each child’s experience of disability is different\\nIt is estimated that, overall, between 500 and 650 million people worldwide live with a significant impairment According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10 per cent of the world’s children and young people, have a sensory, intellectual or mental health impairment Around 80 per cent of them live in developing countries Statistics such as these demonstrate that to be born with or acquire an impairment is far from being unusual or abnormal Specialists, however, agree on a working approximation giving a minimum benchmark of 25 per cent of children aged 0-14 with self-evident moderate to severe levels of sensory, physical and intellectual impairments An additional 8 per cent can be expected to have learning or behavioral difficulties, or both\\nThe Fourth Rwanda Population and Housing Census (2012 RPHC) reports revealed approximately 20% (87,900) of the population of persons with disabilities are children between the ages of five and eighteen\\xa0Many of disabling conditions in children are preventable In Africa, one of the foremost causes of disability are infectious and communicable disease; the incidence of these diseases have been greatly reduced or eliminated in higher income countries Other causes include war, trauma, accidents, and congenital and Non communicable diseases\\xa0\\nEarly identification, referral and management of\\xa0impairments in children\\xa0has been emphasized by the National policy of persons with disabilities and its four years’ strategic plan (2021-2024) especially the strategic objective related to the strengthening of early identification, diagnostic assessment, and intervention, prioritizing children with disabilities\\xa0In response\\xa0 to this, different interventions are being carried out within the health sector However, lack of evidence on disability determinants and factors contributing to the impairment in children constitute a hindrance to the good performance of the above mentioned interventions\\xa0\\nIn partnership with RBC, NCPD and NCDA under the financial and technical support of the UNICEF, UPHLS is planning to conduct a formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda The research shall include the improvement plan\\xa0\\nIt is therefore worthy to conduct the formative research on\\xa0the factors
